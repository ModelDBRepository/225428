Cochran AL, Schultz A, McInnis MG, Forger DB (2017) A Comparison of
Mathematical Models of Mood in Bipolar Disorder (Chapter 12)
Computational Neurology and Psychiatry, Springer Series in
Bio-/Neuroinformat., Eds. Ã‰rdi P, et al. 6:315-341

Is available from Amy L. Cochran's web site:
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amylouisecochran/code">https://sites.google.com/site/amylouisecochran/code</a>
under the link "Comparison of Models of Mood in Bipolar Disorder".

In (Cochran et al. 2017) 6 previously published models and 2 models
that are presented for the first time of bipolar disorder are
compared.

Instructions to run the model are provided in ComparisonMoodinBP/ReadMe.txt

The model generates the figures in the chapter, for example
matlab "Figure 1 Lopez's DTMC"

<img src="./LopezDTMC.png" alt="Lopez DTMC figure" width="550">
contains subplots for paper Fig. 2, 3, 4 (second column bottom panels).

Matlab "Figure 2 Absolute value of 2D OU" 
<img src="./AbsVal2D_OU.png" alt="Abs Val 2D O-U" width="550">
contains subplots for paper Fig. 2, 3, 4 (first column bottom panels).
